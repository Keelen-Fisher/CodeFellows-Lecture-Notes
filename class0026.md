# Component Based UI

## Before starting, knowledge levels assumptions

- React is a a JavaScript library, stemming from JavaScript of course, which is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types of operators, standard built in objects, and methods.

## react hello world [READ](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)

- What are the building blocks of a React app?

The building blocks of a a React App are elements and components.

- What is the difference between an element and a React component?

Elements are what components are made of, where components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

- What are some advantages of React’s component based architecture?

This helps with interactivity through your functions to the page.

## introducing JSX [READ](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

- What is JSX and why do we use it?

JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript, and produces React "elements". Why do we use them because instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

- Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.

You can declare a variable to be any kind of name of preference. Next, you can use the the variable inside JSX by wrapping that in curly braces.

- Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.

It is safe, because by default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

## rendering elements [READ](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)

- Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.

Essentially, react components are independent and can be reusable. They are very well compared to JavaScript functions, only the difference is that components return a different element called HTML. This can be beneficial with understanding front end code and developing your pages affectively.

- Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?

Ui is updated by the invoke of the function connected to the component.

- If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?

The state with then makes the changes to the DOM.

## Additional Questions

- Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I look forward to working on the front end once again and not only brush on my skills with developing react applications, but also become better at learning how to create components.

- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

How to use JSX within a function to then become called whenever I need, and to have full comprehension of the relationship between the child and parent component.
