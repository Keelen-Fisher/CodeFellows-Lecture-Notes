# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

- Roy Fielding is some guy, and he's smart. To continue, he's an American Computer Scientist. one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.

- Right now, the required techniques is to connect communication between a small amount of computers at a time.

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? GET, PUT, and DELETE.

- GET is a retrieval tool to grab the results that the user is asking for. When a machine GETs a resource, it will ask for the machine-readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human-readable "representation" of that data.

- If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

- If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

- PATCH requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request.
