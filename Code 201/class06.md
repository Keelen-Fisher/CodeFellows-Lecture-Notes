# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

- An object like a container filled with variables and functions.

- Object literals are changes made to the entire script, contained with list of pairs.

- Some advantages to creating object literals are sending a request to the server to be put into a database, whereas sending several items individually.

- objects can be changed into different chains and can become efficient in pairing and identification, whereas arrays require more steps to pull one element individually.

- For the ***DOT NOTATION***, you can use it to access a specific value/element using the (.), with bracket notation its basically as similar as arrays, and can be used to set not only values dynamically, but member names too.

- Using this example: ![This](Images/Code%20example%20for%20class06.png)

- The term ***THIS*** refers to the current object the code is being written inside, so in this case it is the name and age in the sentence.

## DOM

- DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents.

- JS can use DOM to access the document and its elements. It isn't a programming language, but without it, JS language would not have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, and other component parts.
