# Class 14a: CSS Transforms, Transitions, and more Animations

## CSS Transforms

- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values. Here's an example of a transform inside of an element:

- ![transform](Images/Transform%20Syntax.png)

- ![transform2](Images/Transform%20Syntax%202.png)

- An example of transform is that you can rotate a figure by first adding a figure element, then in CSS adding in the transform rule to rotate at a certain amount of deg.

## Transitions & Animations

- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS

- Just a couple of lines of code will give a great transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions. What’s more, these effects are hardware accelerated, and a progressive enhancement that you can use right now

- These are the 8 transitions: *Fade In*, *Change Color*, *Grow and Shrink*, *Rotate Elements*, *Square to Circle*, *3D Shadow*, *Swing*, *Inset Border*

- As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

### Notes

- Teammates sometimes jockeyed for leadership positions:

Criticize one another’s ideas.
Conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group.
People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other
Always feeling like needing to be careful not to make mistakes.
Time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more over the last two decades and at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.

Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).

‘It’s better to put introverts together,’
‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’
But which was really true? Either? Neither?
Understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.
The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms were the ones that successful teams shared?
Which would you rather join?

Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.
Team B is different. It’s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another’s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn’t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.

what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.
The right norms could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’

The good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling
If only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.

Psychology researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety.
Psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.

To be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.
In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

- Conclusion: There is no right answer, the individuals in a team are important to understand diversity. So it is okay to lean on each other and discuss who you are to develop a strong connection so that you give them the oportunity to speak, you see value in them instead of an simple associate, as long as everyone still has a cohesive goal that everyone can agree on to a certain point. Act like a kindergardener.

>> "I/we will not let our faliures render us unstable" vs. "I will not let any of us fuck up". We are random by nature, complicated, and we will never fully understand each other. And by nature, we can choose to either apply this knowledge to try and work together, or give up on unity.
