# Class 14a: CSS Transforms, Transitions, and more Animations

## CSS Transforms

- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values. Here's an example of a transform inside of an element:

- ![transform](Images/Transform%20Syntax.png)

- ![transform2](Images/Transform%20Syntax%202.png)

- An example of transform is that you can rotate a figure by first adding a figure element, then in CSS adding in the transform rule to rotate at a certain amount of deg.

## Transitions & Animations

- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
