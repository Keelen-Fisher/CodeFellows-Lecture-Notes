# NODE.JS

## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

- Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute. The creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? This JS engine was written to be executed by web browsers, which in effect can make server-side scripting possible. It's fast and powerful, meaning that it translates JS code directly into machine code.

- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? It means that it is a software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies and running your service.

- npm is the world's largest Software Library (Registry), has over 800,000 code packages and is installed with Node.js.

- What version of node are you running on your machine? Mine has a version of v18.4.0

- What version of npm are you running on your machine? Mine has a version of v8.12.1

- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? You would type the following your terminal: npm install -g jshint

- What is node used for? It is designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  - Greater efficiency
  - Engaged collaboration
  - Learning from fellow students
  - Social skills
  - Job interview readiness
  - Work environment readiness

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? There are two that stands out to me: Work environment readiness and Greater efficiency.

- Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
