| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)     | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.               |
| SQL databases are table based databases and in number of rows          | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.  |
| SQL databases have predefined schema                                   | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.                                   |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable                                  | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.                                                   |
