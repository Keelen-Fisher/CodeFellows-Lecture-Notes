# What in the World Happended?? Troubleshooting JavaScript and The Debugger

## What went Wrong?

- There are different types of error:

  - Syntax Errors: Spelling errors in your code and can cause your program not to run at all, usually okay to fix.

  - Logic Errors: The syntax can be correct, but the code is not what you intend for it to be, meaning that the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. Harder to fix than syntax errors.

  - There have been a great amount of syntax errors, in every lab, there lies so many possibilities to create an error, close to more than half the job of your program is to fix your errors.

  - In this link that discusses [errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong), it is important to know how to fix errors and prepare for them.

## The JS Debugger

- This alows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places it in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing property. This [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger) will explain more.

- A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing.

- The ***Call Stack*** section shows you how to code was executed to get to the current line.
