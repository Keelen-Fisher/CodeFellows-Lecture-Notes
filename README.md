## Bio

Born and raised in Houston Texas, with my family being from Trinidad and Tobago; there were two things in life that facinated me from a kid to a yound man, that was the meaning of success and becoming a hero. I enjoy many things such as fitness, music, art, cooking, sports and reading, but the ability to create a legacy which can be passed down from one generation to another while showing that the impossible is possible was always my goal in life. From there, I ventured into many career paths. From Electrical Engineering, to Environmental Science, to Persoanl Training! Finally, to Computer Science. Now, I want to lead a path of aspiring futurists into a world of technical evolution through programming languages, while providing for my family. I aim to complete this curriculum and finish my journey making the world better, a stronger family, and with satisfaction.
