## What is JavaScript?

 JavaScript is the interavtive piece of your website. dynamic in it's language, it adds versatility and interaction within you program, as stated above.

 > JavaScript reads from top to bottom so make sure to organize your code at all times!

## What Are Variables

- Something that holds data, it can be changes and similar to algebra.

- You need to declare variables in JavaScript has variables that you need to know about:

    - String

    - Number

        - These are going to be the main three that we're going to use in Code 102!

    - Array

    - Object

- You can ***Declare*** a variable by giving it a valuble:

    - let x; <-- declare variable

    - const y = 4; <-- declare variable and assign it a variable

    - let z; <-- declare variable

    - z = 4 <-- reassigning the variable

- There are 3 Ways to Declare a variable:

    - Let: can be changed

    - Const: Doesn't Change

You are also able to comment out lines of code similar to CSS

    - Addition **+**

    - Subtraction, Multiplication, Division **- and / asterisk for multiplication**

    - Assignmnet: **Assigning a value to a variable: =**
