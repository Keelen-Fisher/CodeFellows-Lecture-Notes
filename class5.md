# Designe Web Pages With CSS

## What is CSS

- Cascading Style Sheets is the decoration of your website with extra features to make things stand out besides the words and pictures.

- This language effects the visual elements of the page and modify the content visually

- HTML and CSS go hand in had, you can not have one without the other!

> Think of it as the **sassy** language of style!

- With CSS, you will need to have this language operating at a different page/file:
    - The external style sheet

> **DO NOT** Think that CSS is easy and a cake walk, it can be frustrating!
