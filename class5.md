# Design Web Pages With CSS

## What is CSS

- Cascading Style Sheets is the decoration of your website with extra features to make things stand out besides the words and pictures.

- This language effects the visual elements of the page and modify the content visually

- HTML and CSS go hand in had, you can not have one without the other!

> Think of it as the **sassy** language of style!

- With CSS, you will need to have this language operating at a different page/file:
    - The external Style Sheets

    - Internal Style Sheets

    - Inline Style Sheets

> **DO NOT** Think that CSS is easy and a cake walk, it can be frustrating!

## CSS Syntax

- With CSS being a rule-based language, the rules become defined by specifying groups of styles with the elements provided in HTML.

- Some Syntax include:

    - Under h1 and p:

        - color: you could chose from a plethora of colors to add more of a pop to your font, background, boarder, and much more.

        -  font-size: You can increase the size in pixels

        - font-family: You can change the way a font may look, for example Times New Roman.

- As you type in these properties, **Add Space!**

## The Ways to add CSS

Going back over to the insertion of CSS, there's the three that was previously entailed:

- With The External Style, it is defined within the link element and in the head section of any HTML page, very common style.

- In Internal Styles, it is defined within the stlye element, inside the head section of an HTML.

- Inline Styles are defined within the style attribute of the relevant element.

## Styleception

- You can have multiple style sheets, followed by the rule of course.
