## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)? [READ](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

- Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

- Share an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

What if an end-user's job changes? You may need to manually assign their role to another user, or you can also assign roles to a role group or use a role assignment policy to add or remove members of a role group.

Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

- Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
- Management role group – you can add and remove members.
- Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
- Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

- What are the Benefits of RBAC?

1. ***Reducing administrative work and IT support.*** With RBAC, you can reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role. Instead, you can use RBAC to add and switch roles quickly and implement them globally across operating systems, platforms and applications. It also reduces the potential for error when assigning user permissions. This reduction in time spent on administrative tasks is just one of several economic benefits of RBAC. RBAC also helps to more easily integrate third-party users into your network by giving them pre-defined roles.

2. ***Maximizing operational efficiency.*** RBAC offers a streamlined approach that is logical in definition. Instead of trying to administer lower-level access control, all the roles can be aligned with the organizational structure of the business and users can do their jobs more efficiently and autonomously.

3. ***Improving compliance.*** All organizations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. With an RBAC system in place, companies can more easily meet statutory and regulatory requirements for privacy and confidentiality as IT departments and executives have the ability to manage how data is being accessed and used. This is especially significant for health care and financial institutions, which manage lots of sensitive data such as PHI and PCI data.
