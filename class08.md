# CSS Layout

- CSS Flexbox is a layout machanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension, it excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and return the best layout for those items.

- The difference between main axis and cross axis is cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row, the cross axis runs along the column.

- Using certain properties of flexbox can negatively impact accessibility by using row-reverse and comlumn-reverse. The reprdering only happens in visual order, not the logical order.

- It's difficult to use simple layout designs such as float to center blocks of content inside its parent, or making all colimns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

- You can specify what elements to lay out as flexible boxes by setting a special value of disply on the parent element of the elements you want to affect:

- Section: ![section](c:/Users/Keelen/Desktop/Code%20Fellows%20Code%20201/flexbox%20example.png)

- Sample flexbox example: ![sample](c:/Users/Keelen/Desktop/Code%20Fellows%20Code%20201/flexbox%20display%20example.png)

- Be mindful of text wrap when you use text boxes.
