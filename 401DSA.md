# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Basic Recursion: [Video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

- Recursion can be used for looping and solving a previous problem of yours, like searching for a key in nested boxes. You can break down a problem into a base case and a recursive case. It calls itself which if created incorrectly can lead to an infinite loop. A base case can assist in keeping the function from infinite loops, your recursive case will not. It will keep looping if the base case is not reached within the function.

- You will also be using `pseudocode`, which is a high-level description of how to solve the code.

- Aside from clean and clear look, recursion and while loops works the same way. The upside is that many algorithms use recursion, so it is important to understand.

## Data Structures in 15 Minutes: [Video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

- ***What is data structures?*** A collection of data built within a structure.

- ***Linked List***: atomic number of the linked list is called node, which contains a value and a pointer. The value is a number and the pointer is the connector to the next node. There's a head and tail. You can add and delete new items but hard to retrieve and search nodes.

- ***Array***: A continuous block of cells, really good at retrieving, but can be difficult to add.

- ***Hash table***: Kind of like a dictionary. These memory locations do not have to be all in one place so it's good to add and retrieve but can cause ***collisions***.

- ***Stack and Queue***: Stack is last in first out data structures, with call stacks. Very important for DFM (Depth First Search). Queue is first in first out, like a line in the airport.

- ***Graph and trees***: They have edges and weights. In trees there are parents and children. Be mindful of the order, this can mess with the search optimization.

## Big O Explained: [Video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

- Big O: How time scales with respect to some input variables

- O(1) - Constant time respect to the size of the input,

- O(n): scales linearly with respect to to the size of the input,

- ***Data Structures*** are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently. Data structures have a wide and diverse scope of usage across the fields of Computer Science and Software Engineering.

### 1. Arrays

- An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

### 2. Linked Lists

- A linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.

- Example:  ![Linked List](Images/Example%20of%20Linked%20Lists.png)

### 3. Stacks

- A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

- Example: ![Stacks](Images/Example%20of%20Stacks.png)

### 4. Queues

- A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue — people waiting in a queue.

- Example: ![Queue](Images/Example%20of%20Queue.png)

### 5. Hash Tables

- A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value.

- A special function named as the hash function (h) is used to overcome the aforementioned problem in direct addressing.

- Example: ![Hash Function](Images/Example%20of%20Hash%20Function.png)

### 6. Trees

- A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.

- A binary search tree exhibits a unique property that distinguishes it from other trees. This property is known as the binary-search-tree property.

- Example: ![tree](Images/Example%20of%20Tree.png)

### 7. Heaps

- A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.

- Example: ![Heap](Images/Example%20of%20Heap.png)

### 8. Graphs

- A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.

- The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.

- Example: ![Graph](Images/Example%20of%20Graph.png)

## Why Big O: [Read:](https://triplebyte.com/blog/why-you-should-learn-big-o-and-stop-hacking-your-way-through-algorithms)

### Big-O is just a notation

- Big-O is just the name of the notation used to describe how efficient an algorithm is.

- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

 You would want to consider the problem domain and the expected result, followed by the size of the data.

- How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Make sure that you have a base case involved in your recursive function. A very simple example is from [CodeBurst:](https://codeburst.io/learn-and-understand-recursion-in-javascript-b588218e87ea#:~:text=Base%20cases%20are%20usually%20within,1%3B%20is%20our%20base%20case.)

      function factorial(x)
      {
        **Termination**
       if (x < 0) return;

        **Base: Used to avoid recursive call stack**
       if (x === 0) return 1;

        **Recursion: Initialized call stack**
       return x * factorial(x - 1);
      }

### Things I want to know more about

- I would love to learn more about linked list and Big O notation. I am starting to understand the need for data structures but 5 relationships that establishes the basics of data structures is a bit confusing on the first read/watch especially with linked list and nodes. With Big O, I'm having trouble understanding the time constants and how they relate to the size of data/input/output.
