# Local Storage and How to Use it In Websites

- A web developer would use local storage for a web application because it is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the web without the fear of reseting your works.

- As a developer, you need to store the state of your interface somwhere. Normally, this is done server-side, and you would check the user name to know which state to revert to. With the local storage, you could keep a key on the user's computer and read it out when the user returns.

- Local storage can only use strings for its keys and values. You could use [object Object] for conversion.
