# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

- Why do we need it?

>> Domain modeling is the proces of creating conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constrints that govern the problem domain.

- As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## HTML Table Basics

- What is a table? A structured set of data made uo of rows and columns, and can allow you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connnection between different types of data.

- Tables ***SHOULD NOT*** be used for page layouts because it is rather prefered to [CSS layout techniques](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout). Also, layout tables can reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, and they are not repsonsive.

- There are 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table:
  
  - tr: Table Row Element defines the row of cells in a table.

  - td: Table Data Cell Element difines a cell of a table that contains data.

  - th: Table Header Element defines a cell as header of group of table cells.

## Introducing Constructors

- A constructor is a fubction called using new keywords. As you call a constructor, it will create a new object, run the code in the constructor, return the new object.

- The term *this* when used with an object literal and constructor are as follows:

- Object: ![object](Images/using%20the%20this%20term%20in%20object%20literal.png)

- Construct: ![construct](Images/using%20the%20this%20term%20in%20construct.png)

## Object Prototypes

- From the class 07 reading requirements:

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

  - note: this is a very commin front end developer interview question

- Get back to this question later, speak with instructor.

## Things I want to Know About

Let's try to dive deeper into the purpose of using *this* term and Using tables.
