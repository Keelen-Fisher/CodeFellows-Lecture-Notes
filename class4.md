# Structure Web Pages with HTML

## What is HTML?

- A Hypertext Markup Language

- You have opening and closing tags that surrounds the statements.

- Some elements that are included:

    - head
    - body
    - header
    - paragraph

You want the user to see what's in the body, and the header is gernerally at the beginninig of the body.

### What is a semantic element?

- A general representation of the element used, ex: body, main, all that organizes the code and showcases the simplicity of your code. It asks itself "What is it's job?"
