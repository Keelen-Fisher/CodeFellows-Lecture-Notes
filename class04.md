# HTMl Links, JS  Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

- Hyperlinks allows us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address.

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside of the a tag/element.

- Example: ![link](Images/link%20wrapping%20on%20a%20tag.png)

- The href or ***Hypertext Reference*** contains the web address.

- Some ways that links on the pages of our site can be accessed to all readers are:

- You can secure the path and files/ and using download attributes!

## CSS Layout

### Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

- Normal Flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout. Elements in webpages can lay out in normal flow, if you have yet to apply any CSS to change their behavior.

- Block Level Element fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accomadate its content.

- Inline is within the sentence/line of the HTML and webpage.

- Static positioning is the default that every element gets.

- With absolute positioning, you can create isolated UI features that do not interfere with the layout of other elements on the webpage. In addition, top bottom left and right behave in a different way with absolute positioning.

- The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## JS: Functions and Reusable Blocks of Code

- The difference between a finction declaration and a function invocation is that function declaration is always hoisted, so you can call a function above a function definition and it should work fine. Whereas with invocation, you call that function from either another function or loop.

- The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter/arguments are the names listed in the function's definition, whereas arguments are real values passed to the function.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- Focus on Job interview Readiness
What better way to prepare myself to join a career of long lasting success than with actually learning about the fundamentals of being job ready through my courses? This help's me to take away some of the "Loss of identity" crisis that some beginner employees go through.

- Work Environment Readiness
Similar to interview readiness, work environment can help me to prepare for investing my attire, materials, and community.

## Things I want to Know About

- In the while loop: a variable is set equal to a string value, when it is set to less than another string. is that possible or will the code not run the line because that line cannot apply?
