# AWS: Cloud Servers

## AWS EC2 [READ](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform, with over 500 instances and choice of the latest processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model to help you best match the needs of your workload.

- What is an EC2 Instance?

An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

- Name 2 use cases for EC2.

1. Run cloud-native and enterprise applications

    - Delivering secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.

2. Scale for HPC applications

    - This use case is to access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.

- What is ECS?

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable and fast container management service. You can use it to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster. With Amazon ECS, your containers are defined in a task definition that you use to run an individual task or task within a service.

- Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of Heroku.

ECS offers the aws ecs cli command and its tools can be more ground level. This can give you more access and control in some ways.

## EC2 For Humans [WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZMkgOMYYIg)

- Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

Under the compute section of the AWS Services

- Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.

T2 Micro is a micro virtual machine that has the instance size of t2. micro provides 1GiB RAM and 1 vCPU, and new users can run one of these at no cost for 12 months

Overall, it is about its size and power that makes the difference between the two.

- Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.

It is the fundamental sequence of steps that a CPU performs. Also known as the "fetch-execute cycle," it is the process whereby a single instruction is executed.

## Elastic Beanstalk [WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

- What is Elastic Beanstalk?

Easy to use server that deploys, manages and scales web applications and services for the developer.
It also uses manages containers for whatever language you use.

- Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.

Elastic beanstalk uses EC2 as part of their functionality.

- Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.

Simple to use and can take away the headache of having to rebuild your algorithm and structure of the application and database. This also helps with time balance instead of having to worry about managing and configuring infrastructure.
