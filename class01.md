## Keelen Fisher Presents: The Illustrious power of HTTP, A Poem

>> However can the world link with each other, without you, HTTPS? In correlation with the land of the DNS Server, to discover the place of anyone's request. With the browser, it moves with haste and ready to speak with you to ask for your message, to create and copy. The server, looking above like the one above all glancing at the universe, approves of your essence, and grants the request. The browser then builds around your request, and brick by brick, a masterpiece of a website. This is all for you and your Illustrious Power, HTTP.

## The process of how HTML, CSS, and JS files are "Parsed"

- Browsers can send requests to servers for HTML files, if the HTML file contains a link element, and script for CSS

### How does it Work

- The Browser must recognize the HTMl file first, followed by a recognition of link elements and/or script elements from CSS. Afterwards, the brower will create a Domain Object Model (DOM) tree, next will be a generated in-memory CSS Object Model, then finally will compile and execute the parsed JavaScript.

## Website Design and Process

### Finding Images to add to a Website

- You can either go to google images or a website that offers free images. click on your desired image fo an enlarged view, and right click option on the image and save the image. Another option is to save the image via copying the website.

## Strings vs. Number Application in JavaScript

- For String, It's a sequence of text. An example of is Shown: ![String](String%20vs.%20Number%20in%20JS%20String%20.png)

- For Number, it requires no quotations around the value. An example of it is shown: ![Number](String%20vs.%20Number%20in%20JS%20Number.png)

## Introduction to HTML

- An HTML attribute is somewhat of a special word that can be used inside of an opening tag for a change in the element's display in the website. Can also be called the modifier.

- For the Anatomy of an HTML Element, There is the opening tag, closing tag, content, and element.

- The difference between article and section element tags is that:

    - Article is more self contained, and mainly identified as independent.

    - Section creates standalone sections.

- Most websites contain elements such as main, article, section, header, h1, p1, body, and h2.

- Metadata can influence Search Engine Optimization by its ablitity to search for data.

- The meta HTML Tag is used for redering data to recieve and create an ouput of data on the webpage. Example: pulling up a different language from an outside source.

## Introduction to designing a website

- The first step in designing a website is What exactly do ***YOU*** Want to accomplish?

## Semantics

- The purpose of using h1 for top level heading is By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

- Whereas with span element, it will will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

## What is JavaScript

- A couple of things that require JavaScript in the Browser is displying timely updates and interactive maps.

- JavaScript can be added into your HTML using the same application as CSS. You need to use the script element.
