# Basics of HTML, CSS and JS

## Introduction to HTML Continued

>> The purpose of using semantic elements in the HTML is to establish hiearchy and organization. This prevents unordered placements across your web page and help with how to style the page. It is also important to keep in mind the users, you want to make sure that you're keeping your code easier to understand and readable.

- There are currently 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. h1 represents the main heading, with all the rest being subheadings

- The sup element is short for Superscript, which can specify an inline text. Here's an example: ![sup](Images/Example%20of%20sup%20element%20in%20HTML.png)

- The sub element is short for Subscript, another way of specifying inline text for a lower number. Here's an example: ![sub](Images/Example%20of%20sub%20element%20in%20HTML.png)

- When using the abbr element, it is important to use the attribute title to display the full expansion of the term.

## Learn CSS

- Some ways to apply CSS to the HTML is by using:

- External Stylesheet: CSS within a seperate file in a .css extension. Your external CSS stylesheet can be used with link element.

- Internal Stylesheet: This stylesheet resides in the HTML document instead of the link element, you place in style element.

- Inline Styles: These are CSS implications within a single HTML element, still using style element. This style however, should be avoided due to its inefficiency of implementation. This can cause unessesary code edits for just one change.

- using this image: ![example](Images/Block%20of%20code%20example%20HTML%20.png):

- h1 is the selector, color: black; repesents the CSS declaration, and the padding represents the properties.

## Learning JS

- A string is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks.

- These are some of the JavaScript operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, assignment, strict equality, not and does not equal.

- Functions assist in reusable code. Example could be multiplication, if a person is looking for a way to input values on multiple lines of code while using the same function that has the necessary equation to multiply them, this could be a useful tool to take away unessessary time.

## Conditionals in your code

- An if statement checks a ***condition***, and if it evaluates to ***true***, then the code block will execute.

- The use of an else if statement is that if the condition is proven/return to be false, then the other statement is executed in the else department.

- There are 3 types of comparision operators:

- === and !==

- < and >

- <= and >=

- The difference between:

- &&: ***AND*** you can chain together two or more expressions so that all of the expressions have to individually evaluate to true.

- ***OR*** you can chain together two or more expressions, the difference is that the expressions are individual evaluations.

## JavaScript (Provided by Instructor)

- loosely typed

- It is also dynamic, which means that you can change the type after the variable has been declared.

Example:

let cat;

cat = 3;

cat = 'queeeee';

### Numbers

- numeric data types

- Full number, negative, decimals

### Boolean

- logical data type

- true, false

- truthy and falsey

### Undefined

- Means that it doesn't have a definition ***YET***

- Can break your code (Like a break)

### Null

- Defined as nothing/none
