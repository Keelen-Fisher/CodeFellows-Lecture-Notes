# Programing with JavaScript

> Welcome to Functions, Calls, Control Flows, and More

## Control Flow

### What is Control Flow

- The order of execution of statements in your scripts.

Remember, code process from start of the first line to the end, so organization is important!

- There are ***exceptions***: Such as Conditionals and Loops.

You use conditional structures to create execute multiple options for the user: ***if.....else***

## Functions

> Key words to lookout for: call and variables.

### What are Functions

- A block of code that is designed to perform a particular task

This function can be ***called*** on, or in otherwords when a statement reaches out to the function to ***talk*** to it.

- The most important syntax to know is called ***function***, followed by a ***name*** and then parentheses.

- In order for the code to be ran, you need to insert the [{}] curly brackets. With that, the parameters are created inside the parentheses, and the arguments or values can be received by the function.

### Function Return

- When there's a return statement, the fuction's execution is now at a complete stop. [Example of a Function and Return:](FunctionandReturn.png)

The purpose of these functions is to reuse the code for as many times as you want.
