# What are some of the biggest lessons that I have Learned

- Learning Journal 02:

>> For today, I have learned the value of receiving information and taking it in, dissecting, and retaining what is given to me. it's important not to rush into gathering materials and walk away before actually building with those materials. As an adult, you have so much power in your control. However, you are also 100% responsible for your own learning meaning that you need to understand HOW you learn. You also have to know what you want to learn, and it is important to take in one source of information at a time. Diversity is important with your learning as well as you can help the younger learners. Readiness to learn and the motivation to applies heavily to me. With my outside responsibilities, it's important for me to balance my time because I have to be prepared to effectively apply what I've gathered every single class day, and in life. And when there are days when I do not feel for learning as much as other days, I have to ask myself what can I do remind myself why I need this.

- Learning Journal 03:

>> Patience is the biggest learning of today. After the first two days of Code 201, I came to my first most difficult challenge so far which was learning about for loops and while loops. Learning the importance of being imperfect during this programming challenge was a back and forth tug of war. I also learned the importance of taking a break for my physical wellness, and mental wellness. With this in mind, I plan to place more comments into my program for organization and display.

- Learning Journal 04:

>> I would like to link today's learning with partnership. Connection is very important, it's one of the reason why we are partnering with other classmates. You not only learn through code, but by actually bonding with another. Since I've started CodeFellows, I have focused on being present in so many ways and I have so much more to go. In a sense, this is for the purpose of making up for the days that I was completely reserved. though seclusion has its benefits, it also leaves you with no one. To learn is to grow, and the art of growing becomes much more powerful when you have others next to you growing along. One of my motivators for learning, is for those who are near me, each classmate has a purpose that they believe can be fulfilled. I am one of them.

- Career Partner Hour Report 01:

>> The speaker for 07/15/22: Ryan Pedersen, worked at Microsoft for 11 years.

    Computer graphics since a kid (Started programming since 10 years old!)

There was so much to take away from the presenter:

   The code is actually only a small portion of programming, the concept and material is much bigger in scale compared. Do not to expect to land the dream job on the first try. You need to write code every single day. Troubleshoot, working on a bunch of bugs,  changing jobs frequently,  always venture and search around for bigger and better opportunities.

    Basic coding structures must be memorized "like the back of your hand".  Continue to invest into the interests of other individuals.

    Best ways to connect, for a ton of networking, it can be a tough call on where to look. BE YOURSELF, and show up be natural. Be open and engaging.

Key Take-aways:

What are some skills that one should inhabit when starting in entry level developer jobs? Coding habits: it doesn't matter what you build, just build something! Don't try to invent the next great thing just yet, follow a rule set and intergrade it into software programming. over time, make it complex.

 Any emerging trends that Ryan may be interested in:  Look at the history of large trends that moved the generation. Autonomous vehicles in agriculture. "Why do we need big tractors, what about smaller vehicles composing of automatic functions to create more productivity".  The mindset of one big assistance can break down and decrease productivity by 100%, instead multiply and scale down the size, and should a good group of machines fail to function, the productivity still continues at a 75-60%.

Whatever you do, make sure those are marketable.

 FTE vs. Contractor:

Contractor have a REALLY hard time being involved in a long term commitment between them and entry-level jobs.

More of an investment from an employers point of view for FTE, they want more from you because they believe that you are long-term and willing to change at all times.

- Learning Journal 05:

>> Today's learning is implicated with today's why, which was sparked by today's power hour. Ryan, today's presenter, focused on the importance of becoming a developer. "You have to code every day and be natural" was the biggest take away for me. There is no growth without humility, and there is no such thing as being perfect. To reach a certain level with coding, it is imperative to work on it every chance you can. This can also apply to one's growth outside of this curriculum. Apply this with patience, growth in maturity,  and growing with a community, and this can help with becoming just as successful personally as being a software developer.

- Learning Journal 06, Beginning of second week of Code 201, the "tough week":

>> Rough start all around. I could begin by attempting to place text on this submission. but entirely today was trivial to say the least. It happens, and another day has been completed. I've learned that I will need to prioritize my time, sleep, and not to force everything into one day. There's always another, and the main importance is: What did you learn? Did you grow? Answer to both, yes.

- Career: Talk to Your Network:

>> Jess Parker

Found Through the Code Fellows Campus

What I've learned:
Certificate in Bootcamps and BS Degree are very close to each other at competition, and reassuring detail in bootcamp!

Soft Skills as a junior developer is very important!! Talk about relevant experiences, such as customer service, documentation, business, connections, etc.

Presented her programmer affirmations a great collection of how to embrace the complications of your own code. "I am not my code.", You should appreciate the bugs, because solving bugs can make you better. Always respect the developer inside of you. In the career field, choose your words wisely and approach your team with respect and words of affirmation.

Keep your team/individual projects VERY managed. Do not bloat your responsibilities to the point that you will be unable to finish properly.

One of many things that sets you apart as a Junior Developer is understanding at least a small amount of accessibility in ADA Compliant (Links to an external site.). At least the basics: color contrast, management of auto play in videos.

"When you graduate (because you will), right after your courses work on school and personal projects". This shows that you're going above and beyond your curriculum.

Be comfortable with git, "to be good at git is to also be bad at git".

"W.A.V.E." Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, a good tool to use to evaluate almost any website.

NOT EASY! Yet transformative.

- Learning Journal 07:

>> Speaking with such a professional developer  as Jess Parker, I learned so much from someone who has experienced the best and worst from coding. I was a great sigh of relief that so many others learn the way we do, meaning that some of the learning isn't the most exciting way to learn. it can be tough, it can be painful, and it can be aggravating.  Part of this successful journey requires you to experience such events, to move forward and some return such events with more confidence. one of the best things that I did today, was join that table and asked questions, I've taken one step closer to becoming a great developer.

- Learning Journal 08:

>> I applied what I learned from yesterday's discussion with Jess, and it was extremely helpful. I became flustered and a bit upset trying to remind myself the principles of CSS for Lab 08. My expectations to finish this lab with little issues was high, and I received a reality check. Being able to breathe, walk away and stay persistent with learning CSS brough me to develop yet another website, a small step but a great one.

- Learning Journal 09:

>> I've learned the importance of changing the method to my learning: The goal moving forward is to vocalizing my programs more forward. I need to start speaking about my code line for line on a consistent basis. After speaking with TA's, One of my functions turned out to be an error due to a curly bracket being located in the wrong line of code. With the image provided in today's learning code, it's a good reminder to apply this method daily.

- Career Partner Power Hour: Report #2:

>> Speaker Name:
Code Fellows Alumni In Python Roger Huba.
The topic of the presentation is using a Whiteboard, Solving Problems and Python.
Takeaways:

The first area that employers are looking for is not your code, but do you know how to solve problems.
What they will also want to see is if you are coachable.
What is your thought process when you get stuck?
Sometimes problems will be unsolvable.
Whiteboard guidance:

Problem Domain-Provided. Write it AS PROVIDED, then write down your own interpretation.
Test/Edge Cases - What are some potential cases that will break my code?
Input/Output - What is the datatype?
Visual - Ask the interviewer if there is data that they prefer? Don't just go into any issue with improper assumption. Put the interviewer on the spot. "What type of coding process do you prefer?" "Is this what you're looking for?"
Algorithm - English words of what will happen: Don't jump right into code.  
Pseudo or Code: Could be in your preferred language or what the employer is looking for.

- Learning Journal 10:

>> Teamwork is a beautiful thing for learning. I had the privilege to work with Sue for today's lab. Being able to listen while vocalizing where we needed to navigate our code brought out a way of thinking that I have not used since being in CodeFellows. There was so much to take away. First, conversation. Nowhere did we feel as if we lost each other to the point of having to backtrack tremendously. Also, there's comradery. Being able to lift each other up with so much confidence brings out a mindset that cools you down, and gets you more engaged. What a week. I am looking forward to the next.

- Learning Journal 11:

>> “Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.” After out experience from last week over salmon-cookies, I have been more mindful of how I may approach problem domains. Audrey really assisted with helping me to understand how to effectively read the problem and apply key words to your code, along with some much needed reassurance. Moving forward, I have a new plan to create a plan of action before approaching the answer to prepare myself for Code 301.
