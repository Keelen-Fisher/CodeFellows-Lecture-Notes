## JS React

- What is React?
 it is a Userface Library. Meaning that we use it for creating user interfaces such as websites and applications. It also has a component architecture, with Data Flow and component state react. Mainly front end.

- What is a component?
A compontent is a management tool/collection of data similar to functions which. They work in isolation and return HTML.

- What is the dataflow of React?

- How do we make a React element a DOM element? **Remember that DOM elements is the elements deriving from HTML**
first, here are two examples of React elements:

![example2](Images/React%20Dom%202.png)

React does not become a DOM element until it is passed through React DOM. Here's how to create it:

    - Call React.createElement() and describe its arguments.
    - Use ReactDOM.render() to render an element to a page.
    - Describe how we can build elements out of other React elements.
    - Add child elements and nested child elements.
    - Pass properties to an element.

- React is a User Interface **Library that is agnostic**.
 Meaning that it doesn't care where the user interface will  ultimately display.

- Which direction does data flow in React?
It flows downward **one way**

- Every component manages its own data.
