## JS React

- What is React?
 it is a Userface Library. Meaning that we use it for creating user interfaces such as websites and applications. It also has a component architecture, with Data Flow and component state react. Mainly front end.

- When using React, we now create a webpage(now called App). In the sections of the app (now called components) you can have parts if your work such as the header, body, h2, etc.

- What is a component?
A compontent is a management tool/collection of data similar to functions which. They work in isolation and return HTML.

- What is the dataflow of React?

- How do we make a React element a DOM element? **Remember that DOM elements is the elements deriving from HTML**
first, here are two examples of React elements:
![example1](Images/React%20Dom%201.png)
![example2](Images/React%20Dom%202.png)

React does not become a DOM element until it is passed through React DOM. Here's how to create it:

    - Call React.createElement() and describe its arguments.
    - Use ReactDOM.render() to render an element to a page.
    - Describe how we can build elements out of other React elements.
    - Add child elements and nested child elements.
    - Pass properties to an element.

- React is a User Interface **Library that is agnostic**.
 Meaning that it doesn't care where the user interface will  ultimately display.

- Which direction does data flow in React?
It flows downward **one way**

- Every component manages its own data.

## Class 1 important notes for the entire class

- If you have a problem with the lab, take time to reach out to TA's. If you're behind on labs and focus on the lab now and the previous lab in the evening.

- HEAVY Stuff with information. Pay close attention to React and be prepared to stay after.

- NPM (Node Package Manager): A data base that contains data from all developers, "The github of github" according to John Cokos.

- NPM Test: It's code that runs code. It opens the website an can check if all functions and confirms that your code is working and functional, or not.

- Opinionated Framework: Needs to be organized (opinionated) otherwise the program will not develop the application the way that it should be.

- With the React npx installed into your repo, you have some folders and files implemented into your vs code, some you can touch and others you shouldn't.

- React lets you write things that look familiar to you when it is actually a function. So when you see < app/>, just assoctiate it with a function. So you should not touch app.js, index.html. You will have to run this in its own terminal.

- Creating a JS file, you can name it however you want as long as you have the .js along with it.

- When creating a class, everytime you create one you add in a super().

- In JSX, (HTML format in React javaScript file) you can make a render function with a constructor. in the function App(), you create a return call withthe JSX as the parameter in the parenthesis. after creating the return statement, you need to create the export default (Whatever you're calling) after the call.

- The "attribute" in html is now called "props" in JSX.

- Don't forget, DOM is a hierarchy, there needs to be order in the layout of your page.\

- There are going to be a lot of files to create in React for JS and CSS. You will want to add them into folders after you've developed all the files to your liking.

- In React, you will need to break it down to the most smallest items of your page. It should not be conveluted and long.
