## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness

#### - The following info will contain quotes from the article linked above. These are quotes that called out to me in my current position in my life and how I spend it

- "Doing thankless work for ungrateful takers that didn’t deserve your time in the first place" can lead to a wasteful life. This is an interesting and new perspective, as it is common for others to view being busy as an accomplishment. It means that you're not just doing nothing and you're not growing.

- "Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day."

- "If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken."

## Discussion Questions

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

  - I am a proud software developer that embodies ambition with the qualities of adaptation and connectivity between my partners in any area. I have a profound 5 year background in customer service and hospitality which will help in client conversation and making the correct and moral choice in words. I have also gained problem solving skills and the ability to break down problem domains on step at a time.

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

  - Take a deep breath, and give constructive credit for making to this point of this feature.
  - Reevaluate that what is difficult is not impossible, and that others have been through this issue so it's okay to always ask question.
  - A new method: if it's code, read from the bottom to the top and evaluate each line of code. Try to piece together why this variable is called here, and why this function is called here.
