# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming [READ:](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

- Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. Uses the following concepts:

  - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered
  - A main loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

  - It is ***EventEmitter***; allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

  - The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit.
  - Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.

- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

  - The purpose of Event Driven Programming and how it might be useful is to have a better connections by setting objects with functions that has a sent and received, or if you want to set a callback function with with and action declaration and an action confirmation.
