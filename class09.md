## Learn JS

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in system you are programing, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

- Here's an example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box. It's like you fire off a signal over a webpage link.

- When using an addEventListener() function, you need to specify two parameters. that is:

  - The name of the event we want to register this handler for

  - The code that comprises the handler function we want to run in response to it.

- An Even object: Contains a number of properties that describe the event that occurred. This is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.

- Event bubbling is a term that describe phases in how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. Event capturing is the event starts from top element to the target element.
