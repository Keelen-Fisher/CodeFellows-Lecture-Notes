# The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

>> "The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety."

- It is important to engage in ***deliberate practice***. Deliberate practice can be summarized as:

Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

    - Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
    - Repeated often
    - Feedback on results in continuously available
    - It's highly demanding mentally
    - It's difficult
    - It requires good goals

- Deliberate practice should NOT feel like you've already seen most of the challenges and common problems. It should feel like mental exhaustion when you're finished with a technical challenge.

>> "It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what you learned on the way."

## Carol Dweck's “Growth Mindset”

- There is a lot of power in ***"not yet"***, and how you may approach a challenge is so important. Approach the not yet mindset instead of the **Tyranny of Now**. Never run from difficulty. ***Praise the Process.***

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

- Growth Mindset is the best idea for establishing your own grit. The new-found challenge is to take the best ideas and strongest intuitions and test them.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

- People take what happens to them very personally, we own our success but we also own our failures.

## Measuring Emotional Intelligence

- Self-Awareness Score: 19. This is the lowest score out of the 4, The main reason for this is because of my "gut feeling" or rather the lack thereof. I don't trust gut feelings, instead I assess the logical choices along with what just feels morally correct. I also follow the choice that helps the majority the most and sometimes those choices can goa against how I feel. As long as I see it as correct, I will follow or lead the charge.

- Social Awareness Score: 20. Second to the lowest score of the 4. I do find myself to be an observer, but when it comes to assessing others accurately, I can under evaluate or over. This is why I rank this score as a 3 in question 7, leading to the overall score of 20.

- Self-Management Score: 21. Tied to the highest score of the 4. I can manage my emotions effectively to produce good results from projects and assignments. I can also delegate with others who may feel upset or aggravated with either the results of our work or the team in general.

- Relationship Management: 21. Tied to the highest score of the 4. I hold myself accountable and apologize when necessary. I can also deal calmly, sensitively, and proactively with the emotional displays of others.

## Assessing Bias

- The areas that are strong for me in this assessment would be Bias and identity, Bias and the Brain, and Meaningful Connections all with a score of 12.

- The areas that are weak for me in this assessment is effective courage scored at 6.

- Within the the coming weeks of my last course, I plan to work on courage and the ways of calling to action. I need to work on my strength in my intelligence and know that my ideas are valid.
