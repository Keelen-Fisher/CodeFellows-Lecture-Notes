- Non-Relational Database:

Mongoose is a library consisting of Schema and model.

Everything saves as a document made uo of JSON/ an object of unrelated data.

Schema: Diagram or template of what the data will look like.

Model: Comes with all the functionality, of what we need to implement and interact with our data.
