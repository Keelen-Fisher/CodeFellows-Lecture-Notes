[Project Dragonfly, Googleâ€™s censored search engine](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)

- Gathering from this article, there is apparently a moral and ethical crisis with the increase and new development of censored search engine. According to about 1,400 google employees and counting, this censorship violates Google's own principle morals. This search tool that is being brought up is called Dragonfly and has caused a bit of an outrage due to users in China being unable to see web pages that discuss human rights, peaceful protests, and democracy speaking points. This "business being good for shareholders and bad for humanity" statement has it's pros and cons. In terms of what is moral, it is hard to set that based on what is law. if this is a push to silent the majority of any establishment, then the human in me may come to despise this act to close off millions of people from being able to grab a different perspective that is not common amongst their county/world. In addition, this move is not with the ambition to help people, but to enter into the Chinese market. This goes against their stance in 2010, which can make the company hypocritical in some peoples eyes. However, there is also the idea that the this type of expansion was going to happen sooner or later, and can bring a long lasting unification between the chinese government and the US government, as a way to move forward in the future with more trust amongst the nations. This act can make a big impact moving forward for new projects to and from different countries, but at the expense of Google employees's role of speech and consideration? These actions can turn back on those who are apart of these inventions but does not condone it, leaving people feeling unheard and even unsafe. Again, there are underlying issues on both sides of this controversial invention, and with this being pushed to the public, and make an impact in both negative and positive ways.

[Cyber-Security of self driving cars](https://phys.org/news/2017-02-cybersecurity-self-driving-cars.html)

- it is surprising to me that there are already 10 million self-driving cars that are on the road since 2020. It shows that technology is progressing fast, but so is the lack of safety. According to this article, although this idea is a tad bit far fetched than practical, many consumers beg the question of whether or not their cars are prone to be hijacked by hackers. This, however is not impossible with one key detail, if the car connects to the outside world of internet, the cloud, and sensors. In this case, it will be more practical. Some practical solutions to go along with this concern is networks. This is something that airplanes have to risk virtual hijacking. This leads to the overall concern, aside from the fact that there is not much to hijack within a vehicle, there will be, and there's not a lot of security measurements to prevent these circumstances to occur. As an ambitious and self-proclaimed future Tesla owner, this is concerning. This is also exciting for someone who is coming into the tech world soon. I would like to look into cyber security and be a part of a revolutionary way to fight against future hackers before they even get the chance. This is also why start up companies are looking for more security workers and will increase opportunities. The security company needs work, and most companies will not change until there is no other choice, security included. With that being said, it will be imperative for new engineers to be innovative once again.
